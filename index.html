      There's nothing quite as iconic as the home run in baseball. Over the last few decades the MLB has seen a shift with batters, the amount of home runs hit per game
      are higher than ever before, with even more being hit in the playoffs. Fans, professionals and coaches are all trying to understand this new statistical trend. But
      how much of a shift is there really? This graph follows the average amount of home runs hit by teams per game in the postseason as well as the same teams in the 
      regular season. While their performance may be above the average compared to teams which did not make the playoffs, this graph details that there is no significant 
      difference between a teams seasonal home run average compared to their performance in the postseason.

      Click on any of the data points to see a breakdown by year of each team who played in a playoff series compared to their own regular season home run average.

          This graph displays each team's difference in home run average (HRA) for their entire series performance. Any bar below the x-axis would mean the team has performed
          worse than their seasonal average, while any teams performance exceeding their average would be the opposite.
